# EUCLID PROBE
The highly accurate, magneticaly coupled Z-Probe that is not affected by bed temp, bed material, magnetism or surface treatment.

The probe can be configured to be used as Z-endstop, be manually or automatically deployed via gcode macros, and can take advantage of the firmware's probe pickup detection scheme to ensure pickup/release. It uses screw attached magnets for both mechanical coupling and for electrical contact. The Z-Probe circuit is completed when the probe is attached.

The unique dock design securely captures the probe, providing secure and reliable docking and undocking.
