# Installing Mainsail

The recommended way to install Mainsail on a Raspberry Pi is to use [MainsailOS](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/), a pre-packaged disk image. If you are building a custom configuration, you may need to skip these instructions and install Mainsail [manually](#mainsail-manual-installation).


## MainsailOS
To install Mainsail on a Raspberry Pi:
1. Download and install [pi-imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Click "Choose OS" and scroll down to "Other specific-purpose OS".
3. Select "3D Printing" and choose "Mainsail OS". 
4. Choose your SD Card. 
5. If you will be using wifi, click on the GEAR icon in the bottom right corner and enter your wifi information. DO NOT EDIT THE USERNAME. 
6. Click on "SAVE" and on "WRITE". *THIS WILL DESTROY ALL DATA ON YOUR CARD*.
7. Make sure that your MCU(s) is connected to your pi. If you will be using wired networking, also make sure your ethernet cable is connected.
8. Insert the microSD card into your Pi, and power on the Pi.    
9. Find your Pi on the network, and ssh into it (using PuTTY on Windows or the terminal on MacOS)  
   
   The default username is `pi` and the password is `raspberry`.
    * If your network supports bonjour, the pi should show up as `mainsailos.local`
    * If your network automatically assigns DNS hostnames, it may simply show up as `mainsailos`
    * Failing these two options, you may need to check your router's DHCP server, and find out what IP address as been assigned to the device.
 
### Software Update
As soon as you have MainsailOS loaded, it is highly recommended that you make sure all the software is up to date.  (At times, the downloaded image file contains fairly out of date software.)

1. Access Mainsail through a web browser, using whatever IP or hostname you found above.  
(Note, you will see some errors regarding the non-configured state of your printer.  These can be ignoredâ€¦ for now)
2. Click the "Machine" button on the left side of the screen
3. In the "Update Manager" panel, click the refresh button
4. Click the "Update" button for each component that needs updating.
