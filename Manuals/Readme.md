## INSTRUCTIONS

First up, assembly. We have produced modified Manual that should make assembly easy. Please read the manual through the first time before starting your assembly as it will make understanding the relations between objects much more easier. All heat inserts are done so those steps are for you to just verify that all of them are inserted. Should there be any missing, you have tooltip and nerlings to add finishing touches.

You should keep always your devices behind VPN for additional security. That being said, Fluidd supports user accounts while MainsailOS is wide open in your home network. Both are amazing lightweight tools to handle your Voron and since they are simple frontends for configuration, you can easily swap between them.

If you want to see how assembly of a Voron would look like, step-by-step, there is a great fella on YouTube named [Scott Corn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHWiCs52pK4&list=PLSdS8RXoNhoRzDMZr9bK9-mfZjJzyWP8E) who has made a series from assembly of Voron V2.4. Your kit is V2.4R2 with some extra goodies so gatry and toolhead will be different for you.
