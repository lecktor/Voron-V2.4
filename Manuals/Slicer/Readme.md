# Notes about slicer

1. You need to adjust slicer profile per material you are using
2. If you are not using 350mm bed, adjust bed size.
3. If you are using different nozzle, then adjust it's size.
4. We recommend using [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer) for Voron Printers but you can also use [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer).
5. Select Voron V2.4 Afterburner 0.4 nozzle as it closest default preset in slicer.
6. You can import PIF profiles in this folder, but please do read first on 
[Ellis-PIF-Profile](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Ellis-PIF-Profile). These files are from him.
